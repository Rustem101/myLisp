# myLisp
A Lisp-like interpreter in C, capable of parsing and evaluating expressions using the mpc library. 
The interpreter supports various data types including numbers, symbols, and lists (both S-expressions and Q-expressions). 
It offers a range of built-in functions including arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), conditionals (if, >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=), and 
list manipulation (head, tail, join, eval). Additionally, the interpreter allows users to define and apply custom functions.
